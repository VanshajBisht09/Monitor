This will be an online single-player card game that consists of 4 different types of cards
- Cat Card 😼: Simply removed from the deck when drawn.
- Defuse Card 🙅‍♂️: Can defuse an Exploding Kitten card if drawn later.
- Shuffle Card 🔀: Reshuffles the deck with 5 new cards.
- Exploding Kitten Card 💣: Causes the player to lose immediately if not defused.

There will be a button to start the game. When the game is started there will be a deck of 5 cards ordered randomly. Each time user clicks on the deck a card is revealed and that card is removed from the deck. A player wins the game once he draws all 5 cards from the deck and there is no card left to draw.

Rules –
- If the card drawn from the deck is a cat card, then the card is removed from the deck.
- If the card is exploding kitten (bomb) then the player loses the game.
- If the card is a defusing card, then the card is removed from the deck. This card can be used to defuse one bomb that may come in subsequent cards drawn from the deck.
- If the card is a shuffle card, then the game is restarted and the deck is filled with 5 cards again.
