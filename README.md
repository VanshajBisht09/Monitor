This will be an online single-player card game that consists of 4 different types of cards

- Cat card 😼
- Defuse card 🙅‍♂️
- Shuffle card 🔀
- Exploding kitten card 💣

- There will be a button to start the game. When the game is started there will be a deck of 5 cards ordered randomly. Each time user clicks on the deck a card is revealed and that card is removed from the deck. A player wins the game once he draws all 5 cards from the deck and there is no card left to draw.
